<section><h2>What We Do</h2>
  <p class ="p1">We created Pupr to make meeting new people and dogs in easier than ever before. Pupr is the ultimate online destination for dog lovers to connect with others just like them in a unique wayâ€”a dog dating site if you will. We give you resources to create a profile for your pooch with all the pertinent information, and we give you plenty of space to show off favorite pictures.</p>

  <h2>How it works</h2>
  <p class="p2">We want to give dog owners, enthusiasts and yes, dogs, an online home like no other. Our community is designed to help you find other nearby dogs and dog owners to set up playdates or breeding opportunities. We offer a number of search options so you can sort by location, breed, pedigree, color, age and many other criteria. This advanced matching system is much more effective than any classified ads.</p>
